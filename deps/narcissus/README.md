# Narcissus

Narcissus is a JavaScript interpreter written in pure JavaScript (i.e., a [meta-circular evaluator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-circular_evaluator)), using the [SpiderMonkey](http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey/) engine.

Originally a proof-of-concept by [Brendan Eich](http://brendaneich.com/), Narcissus is being revived as a test-bed for rapidly prototyping new language features for the JavaScript language (as well as the ECMAScript standard).
